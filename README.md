# Euler Project Solutions

This repo is being used for my Project Euler problems' solutions.

Please remember, if you have not solved the problems on your own yet, may my solutions can be spoiler to you.

I am happily open to any suggestions and improvements for these solutions.

# About Project Euler

from Wikipedia 
 
> Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide. It includes 789 problems as of 14 March 2022, with a new one added approximately every week. Problems are of varying difficulty, but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer. As of 27 April 2021, Project Euler has more than 1,000,000 users who have solved at least one problem, in over 100 different programming languages.
